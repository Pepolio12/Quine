The Quine-McCluskey (QMC) Algorithm is a systematic method for simplifying Boolean functions. It's an alternative to the Karnaugh Map (K-map), 
especially useful when dealing with functions that have many variables (more than 4 or 5), where K-maps become visually cumbersome.
Its main goal is to find the minimal (most simplified) form of a Boolean expression. This is crucial in digital circuit design 
(to make them more efficient and with fewer components) and in areas like artificial intelligence (for optimizing logical rules).
